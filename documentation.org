* Cache

Dynamic table of static cache objects
The static object contains:

- A dynamic counter incremented on every render. During the first render, the counter is always incremented. If the counter is > to the size of the dynamic table, then the size of the dynamic table is incremented. During next renders, if the counter is > to the size of the dynamic table, then the counter is reseted to 0
- The last value of the function parameters
- The last function result (a tree of inccup forms)
- An array containing all dynamic tables (of static cache objects) of all sub components

A new static cache object is created on every call to the html macro or to a function defined with the defhtml macro. The new static cache object is dynamically bound in order to be used by the underlying function.

* Children reconcialiation

Maybe set nodes ID using metadata ? -> Avoids the need to create the node in order to check its ID + All compiled nodes have a literal (static) vector
