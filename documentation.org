* Container tags / void tags

When outputting datastructures, inccup treats all tags as container tags,
and never as void tags. This makes the ::default compilation strategy much simpler. It is the responsability of the caller to remove the content of void tags if needed.
* Code analysis
The code is analyzed in order to find which part of the defhtml function bodies depend on the defhtml function input parameters. The analyzed cljs AST is emitted using a customized emit* method. We could keep the code as it is written by the user but then macros would be expanded two times.
